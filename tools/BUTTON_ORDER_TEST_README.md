```

## Technical Details

The test validates the fix by:
1. Reading the `templates/form/formButtons.tpl` file
2. Parsing the template structure to find button sections
3. Verifying the order of button generation code
4. Confirming the sequence matches the expected order

The fix ensures that the template renders buttons in this order:
1. Cancel button (Go Back)
2. Save button (Save for Later) 
3. Submit button (Submit Review)

This addresses the user experience issue where the primary "Submit Review" button was appearing in the middle instead of at the end.
